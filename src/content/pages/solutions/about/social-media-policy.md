# Social Media Policy 

## We’re on Facebook, Instagram & X (Twitter) and look forward to having fun and hearing what you have to say. 

The terms below apply to our social media pages and how you interact with them (Agreement) . All references to: 

(a) ‘you’ means the individual or business customer requesting the services and / or goods from us, or interacting with our social media pages; 

(b) ‘we’, ‘our’ or ‘us’ means: 

THE TRUSTEE FOR STEVEN P BLOOM TRUST trading as Bloomwood Solutions (ABN 40 264 085 778) and our unique social media pages and channels;  

(c) ‘social media’ means Facebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), WhatApp or any other platform we use now or in the future. 

While you’re on the Bloomwood Solutions social media pages, we need you to abide by some simple rules: 
 
- Be polite – even if you disagree. Contributing to the discussion is great, but offensive remarks and foul language will not be tolerated. 
- Comments on our posts that are unrelated and unwarranted will also not be tolerated. 
- All wall posts need to come from a real person and social media profile. Fake or anonymous posts will be deleted. 
- Multiple or repetitive posts by a single user or posts which threaten or defame a person or organisation have no place here. Repetitive posts copied and pasted or duplicated by single or multiple users have no place here. If that’s your post – it’ll get deleted. 
- Multiple or repetitive posts on the same general topic (even if the post content differs), by the same user, will be viewed as spam and deleted. 
- We encourage our team members to join the Bloomwood Soltuions social media community and participate in conversations with our customers and stakeholders but all work and office related issues need to be kept at work. 
- Of course, it goes without saying that we expect you to abide by Facebook’s, Instagram’s & Twitter’s own rules:
