# Cairns Region Coverage Map 

This map highlights the extensive coverage area of Bloomwood Soltuions onsite services, ensuring that both residential and business clients within an 80KM radius of Cairns CBD receive top-notch I.T. support. From the heart of the city to the surrounding suburbs and out into the region, our team is ready to provide solutions for your technology problems. 

## What about beyond Cairns? 

We also service beyond the Cairns Region using a state-of-the-art remote access service.  

# Remote Access Service 

Our remote access service is provided by Helpwire. Security features include: 

### Direct Connections
 

By default, HelpWire connects operators and clients directly, with no relay servers in between. That means faster sessions, less exposure, and stronger end-to-end security.
 

### Secure Data Centers 

If a direct connection isn’t possible, HelpWire routes traffic through trusted AWS infrastructure, used by NASA, Netflix, and BMW. All data stays encrypted and fully anonymized. 

 

### Protected Data Flow 

All remote session data is encrypted in transit using WSS and HTTPS protocols, shielding every interaction from interception or tampering. 

### TLS/SSL and AES Encryption 

HelpWire uses TLS/SSL protocols and AES-256 encryption to ensure strong, reliable protection for every remote session. 

### User-Controlled Access 

Clients grant access on their terms and can revoke it at any time, using a shortcut or the in-app button. 

 

### Trustworthy Authentication 

HelpWire uses Auth0 for secure, standards-based login, trusted by Microsoft, AWS, and Siemens. 

 

### Signed Applications 

All HelpWire apps are DigiCert-signed to prevent tampering, just like IBM and Cloudflare rely on.
