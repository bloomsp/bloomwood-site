## 1. Purchasing services from us

You may purchase services from us on the following basis:

### 1.1 On-demand services

(a) On-demand services include three types of support:

- **Onsite support** – troubleshooting and technical assistance provided at your premises.

- **Remote support** – troubleshooting and technical assistance provided over the internet or telephone.

- **Flat-pack assembly** – assembly of furniture or equipment packaged for self-assembly.

(b) We will perform the services and supply the goods specified in your booking at the rates set out on our website and in your booking confirmation. Our current rates (all amounts include GST) are:

- Onsite support – **AU$120 per hour**

- Remote support –**AU $80 per hour**

- Flat-pack assembly –**AU $40 per hour**

(c) A **one-hour minimum charge** applies to all services. After the first hour:

- Onsite support is billed in **30-minute increments**; and

- Remote support is billed in **15-minute increments**.

(d) Most issues can be solved in the first hour. If we expect that more time will be required, we will let you know within the first 30 minutes and provide options before proceeding.

(e) For onsite services, we guarantee that we will either resolve your problem or not charge you for the onsite service.

(f) Our on-demand services are available either onsite or remotely at our discretion. For example, if circumstances (such as public-health restrictions) require remote support, we may elect to provide remote services even where you originally requested onsite services.

### 1.2 Service Packs

(a) In addition to on-demand services, you may purchase **Bloomwood Solutions Service Packs** (for example, the _Explorer_, _Adventure_, or _Progress_ pack). Each Service Pack provides a pre-paid allocation of hours that may be used for onsite or remote support at discounted rates.

(b) The inclusions, pricing, and validity periods for each Service Pack are detailed on our website.

- Onsite time is deducted in **30-minute increments** (minimum one hour per visit).

- Remote time is deducted in **15-minute increments** (minimum 15 minutes per session).

(c) Service Pack hours are valid for **12 months** from the date of purchase. Any unused hours after this period will expire and are non-refundable.

(d) Service Pack hours may not be exchanged for cash, transferred to another person, or used for goods or services not listed as part of Bloomwood Solutions’ standard offerings.

(e) Purchasing a Service Pack does not guarantee priority scheduling, but we will make every effort to accommodate your preferred booking times.

(f) Where a Service Pack balance is insufficient to complete a task, additional time will be charged at the applicable on-demand rate or you may purchase another pack.

(g) The Service Pack discount applies only to the hours included within that pack. Once all included hours are used, normal hourly rates apply to any additional time unless you purchase another pack.

(h) Service Packs cannot be combined with other offers or promotional discounts.

### 1.3 Service area

(a) We provide onsite services within an **80 km radius of Cairns**. If you are located outside this radius, we will offer remote support instead.

(b) You are responsible for ensuring that a person aged 18 years or older is present at the premises during the provision of onsite services.

### 1.4 Business hours

(a) Our business hours (Australian Eastern Standard Time) are:

- Monday to Friday: 9:00 am – 8:30 pm

- Saturday and Sunday: 9:00 am – 5:00 pm

(b) We may from time to time designate days on which we do not provide services (for example, Christmas Day and New Year’s Day), in which case we will notify you via our website or at the time of booking.

### 1.5 Cancellation

(a) If you cancel or reschedule an onsite or remote service with less than 24 hours’ notice, we may charge a **cancellation fee of AU $60**.

(b) If we charge a cancellation fee, we will apply a credit equal to that fee to your account. This credit may be used against a future service booked within one year.

(c) We will not charge a cancellation fee if you cancel more than 24 hours before the appointment or if cancellation is required because of circumstances beyond your reasonable control.

(d) Cancellation of a Service Pack purchase after payment will only be accepted where no hours have been used. In such cases, a **10 % administrative fee** may apply. Once any portion of a Service Pack has been used, no refund is available.

### 3.3 Deposit for remote services

The balance of the remote service fee (calculated at the hourly rate set out in clause 1.1(b)) is payable upon completion of the service (see section 5.1 for payment terms).

Where you hold a Service Pack, this deposit will be deducted from your Service Pack hours rather than charged separately.

## 4. Repairs and goods

(a) Goods presented for repair may be replaced by refurbished goods of the same type rather than being repaired.

- delays or service disruptions (other than our same-day guarantee);

- loss or corruption of data, software or media;

- viruses or system failures

- incidental or unavoidable impacts associated with attending your premises, including vehicle-related condensation, dust, mud, tyre marks or similar minor, non-negligent environmental effects;

- any cosmetic, environmental, or incidental outcome that does not arise from our negligence; or

- events beyond our reasonable control.

(c) Where you have purchased a Service Pack, our liability under that pack is limited to the total amount paid for the unused balance of hours at the time the claim arises.

(d) We are not liable for any loss caused by your own acts or omissions (for example, failure to follow our advice or reasonable directions).

## 8. Termination

Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately by written notice if the other party breaches a term which cannot be remedied or fails to remedy a breach within 10 days of notice. We may suspend services at any time due to your breach (including non-payment) or to prevent damage or misuse of our services.
