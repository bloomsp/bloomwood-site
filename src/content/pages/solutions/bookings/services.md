    WiFi not working as well as it should? Give us a call and we can come and work out where the problem is, and propose a solution. We use various apps and hardware to test signals and determine where or if there is a problem. Sometimes it's just a matter of putting equipment in a more optimal position! Analysis of your specific situation is critical to determining the right solution and avoid unneccessary expense. Don't waste money on a new router or WiFi mesh until you really understand the problem.

    Got an old computer that wont boot or start up but you want the data from it? Got some old hard drives but don't know how to access the data on them? Or maybe you've tried to access the data, but your computer wont read the disk?
    <p>
    Call me, I have experience is recovering data from hard drives no matter the operating system. Typically specialised software and sometimes hardware is required to recover data from damaged drives.
    If the disk is still spinning and can be powered on, then there is a high chance of recovering the data. Typical cost would be $250 per drive
    <p>
    If there is physical damage to drives, the disk platters, or the onboard circuitry, then it may not be possible to recover the data without a significant expense to restore the hardware to an operational state. In these cases the drive would be sent to a hardware specialist at your expense and a quote for repair and data recovery provided before proceeding.

  We use HelpWire for remote access because it's not like any other remote access solution. Instead of downloading a generic remote control software package that ANYONE can connect to, HelpWire, provides a unique app for each client. There are no relay servers in between, which means faster sessions, less exposure, and stronger end-to-end security.
  <p>
Clients grant access on their terms and can revoke it at any time, using a shortcut or the in-app button. All HelpWire apps are DigiCert-signed to prevent tampering, just like IBM and Cloudflare rely on.

      We have experience with WordPress and Concrete CMS. Hundreds of layouts to choose from which makes for rapid development and setup. We can also build a custom design just like the one we made for Bloomwood Solutions and Bloomwood Media. In fact, we used to use Wordpress for Bloomwood Solutions and Concrete CMS for Bloomwood Media, and recently redesigned the whole lot in Astro, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/UI components. It's not 10 times faster and more responsive than ever. It's also easy to maintain and update as most pages are simple markdown. We also made extensive use of AI to do all the heavy lifting for us and it took less than four days to migrate both sites from WordPress/Concrete to Astro.

We also used the AI to make continuous updates and changes, simply by typing our requirements to our special ChatBot we call Robby. Robby uses OpenAI Codex backend systems to do all the AI crunching, but the chat bot runs directly on my Mac Studio computer in my office. I communicate with it via Telegram, so I can tell it to make an update to my website anywhere, any time!
