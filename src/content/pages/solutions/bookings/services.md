      Installing a network can be easy if you know what you're doing. Whether you need an upgrade to your home or
      small business network, we can work with you to define your requirements based on your needs and help you select
      the best solution.

      Wi‑Fi not working as well as it should? Give us a call and we can come and work out where the problem is, and
      propose a solution. We use various apps and hardware to test signals and determine where (or if) there is a
      problem.
      <p class="mt-3">
        Sometimes it’s just a matter of putting equipment in a more optimal position. Analysis of your specific
        situation is critical to determining the right solution and avoiding unnecessary expense. Don’t waste money on
        a new router or Wi‑Fi mesh until you really understand the problem.

      Printers are usually easy to set up, but sometimes it helps to understand how they work with your operating
      system to avoid annoying issues (like wrong paper trays or connecting to a Wi‑Fi network).

        Make sure you download the manufacturer’s printer driver software to ensure optimal usability and performance.

      Got an old computer that won’t boot, but you want the data from it? Got some old hard drives but don’t know how
      to access the data on them? Or maybe you’ve tried to access the data, but your computer won’t read the disk?
      <p class="mt-3">
        Call me — I have experience recovering data from hard drives across different operating systems. Typically,
        specialised software (and sometimes hardware) is required to recover data from damaged drives.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        If the disk is still spinning and can be powered on, there is a high chance of recovering the data. Typical
        cost is <strong>$250 per drive</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        If there is physical damage to the drive platters or onboard circuitry, it may not be possible to recover the
        data without significant expense. In these cases, the drive would be sent to a hardware specialist at your
        expense and a quote for repair and data recovery provided before proceeding.

      We use HelpWire for remote access because it’s not like a generic remote control package that anyone can try to
      connect to. HelpWire provides a unique app for each client.
      <p class="mt-3">
        Clients grant access on their terms and can revoke it at any time. All HelpWire apps are DigiCert-signed to
        prevent tampering.
