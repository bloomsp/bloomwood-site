        "quote": "Steven and Jason have been communicative throughout the video shooting process for our assignment, and this includes giving feedback on our body language and clarity of voice as well as reviewing our prepared script to see if it can be amended to better convey the intended message of the video.\n\nThey come well prepared with the proper equipment such as clipped-on microphones, teleprompter, and a high quality video camera, and Steven has been quick in producing the first draft of the video as per the instructions outlined in our prepared script and storyboard.\n\nSubsequently, Steven has also promptly address the amendments we require for the video with strong understanding of what needs to be changed/improved as shown by the quality of the updated versions of the video, and was well aware of the urgency of the situation.\n\nHence, I would recommend their service to anyone who needs the complete package when it comes to producing a video.",

        "quote": "After wasting ridiculous amounts of money and suffering ongoing frustration with my website, I am finally in clear air. Thank you for your help, Steven, and for guiding me so gently through the fog of misunderstanding my WordPress website.\n\nI am so happy with the result and my small business is benefiting from the improvements you have suggested, particularly as I am able to make changes myself. There doesn’t appear to be anything that stumps you and you have fixed and set up everything perfectly. I never seem to have any hiccups anymore and your attention to detail is thorough.\n\nI would recommend you to anyone who needs a truly capable technology consultant.",

        "quote": "Bloomwood Media: The Wonder Boys\n\nBefore Bloomwood Media came to my rescue, I thought nothing could be done about the dilemma I was in. There seemed a zero chance of meeting the publishing deadline for a little gem of a book that was written but was not yet fit for print. The book’s deficiencies were acute—there was no cover, page layouts were undone and the deadline was unforgiving.\n\n“No worries,” the Wonder Boys at Bloomwood assured me. “We can do this.” They did it and they didn’t flinch.\n\nThey created a tantalizing cover and formatted pages, photo spreads and just-the-right fonts. Then they designed a showcase for handwritten letters an American G.I. had sent home from the Korean War. Soon, the remarkable book Don’t Flunk Retirement went to print two days before the deadline.\n\nI live in America and Bloomwood execs Jason and Steven are in Australia. Even so, they fixed what was broken and, aside from time differences, it felt like they were in the office next door. How cool is that?",

        "quote": "I have engaged Jason on various projects to complete user and support documentation.\n\nJason always had tight deadlines but has been able to work closely and effectively with Business Analysts, technical teams and business users to ensure all deliverables were completed on time.\n\nJason is patient and calm under pressure, he is friendly and has clear communication. Jason has always provided high quality documentation, including domain-specific material, application help and business processes. I would highly recommend Jason to any company seeking quality documentation.",
