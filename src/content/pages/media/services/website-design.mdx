# Website Design


There are lots of ways to get your story on the web.  We specialise in helping small businesses and individuals present themselves online.  Whether you’re a small online business, or bricks and mortar, or an individual offering their services, we can help you design a website that works for you.

We have experience in two major Content Management Systems - WordPress and Concrete CMS. A CMS is for websites that want lots of features and are especially interested in constantly updating your content.  For websites that don’t require the complexities of WordPress and have content that doesn’t change so regularly we use pure HTML and the Bootstrap CSS Framework.  

Whether you choose WordPress, Concrete or HTML they all offer a convenient methods of updating the website all via your own browser.

What does Bloomwood Media use? We love Concrete! Why? It's easier to use, more intuitive, and is built with security in mind.
