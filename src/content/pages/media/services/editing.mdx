# Editing


We love words, and we love reading.  If you’re a budding writer, or a seasoned writer and need someone to help edit your masterpiece then you’ve come to the right place. Our services are tailored specifically for your needs and include, but not limited to the following:


- **Full copyedit**, also known as a line edit. This entails a line by line reading of the piece, correcting errors (spelling, grammar, punctuation), but also structural problems, such as continuity (i.e. a character is 25 years old on page 1 but aged 26 on pages, 3, 7 and 9). Additionally, if a passage is wordy or awkward, we can help with that, too.


- **Errors only copyedit**. This is a copyedit where corrections are made to grammar, spelling and punctuation.

Documents can be submitted in any format, for example MS-Word, Pages, PDF or even TXT.  We do prefer either Pages or Word as these have the ability to track changes that are made which allow you to see the changes we make when we return the document to you.
