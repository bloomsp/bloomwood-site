# Gooey Chocolate Pudding

**Recipe by:** Nigella Lawson (from *How to Eat*)

## Summary
This recipe combines the creaminess of pudding with the density of moist chocolate cake. Only five ingredients, so it’s quick and easy.

## Ingredients
- 125 g (4.4 oz) dark chocolate, finely chopped
- 125 g (4.4 oz) unsalted butter
- 3 large eggs
- 150 g (5.3 oz) sugar
- 35 g (1.23 oz) plain flour

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 200 °C (390 °F).
2. Melt the chopped chocolate and butter (double boiler or a food processor). Whisk occasionally until fully melted.
3. In another bowl, combine eggs, sugar, and flour until just blended. Gradually whisk into the chocolate-butter mixture.
4. Grease 4–6 ramekins (depending on size) with butter. Dust with flour and tap out excess.
5. Pour mixture into ramekins and bake 10–12 minutes, until tops are firm and cracking slightly, and edges are set.

Serve immediately (they’ll be very hot).
