# Blueberry Cheesecake

**Recipe by:** Food Network (with thanks to Dean Marmont)

## Summary
This delicious recipe makes a heavenly baked cheesecake, complete with blueberry sauce.

## Ingredients
### Crust
- 2 cups finely ground digestive biscuits (aka graham crackers)
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon (to taste)
- 1 stick unsalted butter, melted

### Filling
- 500 g (1 lb) cream cheese
- 3 eggs
- 1 cup sugar
- Just under 500 ml sour cream (1 pint)
- Zest of 1 lemon
- Dash vanilla extract

### Blueberry sauce
- Just under 500 g blueberries (1 pint)
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced
- 2 tbsp sugar

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 170 °C (325 °F).
2. **Crust:** In a bowl, combine crust ingredients with a fork until evenly moistened. Lightly coat the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan with non-stick spray. Press crumbs into the base and ~1 inch up the sides (use the bottom of a measuring cup or a glass). Refrigerate 5 minutes.
3. **Filling:** Beat cream cheese on low speed ~1 minute until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, beating slowly until combined. Gradually add sugar; beat until creamy (1–2 minutes). Add sour cream, lemon zest, and vanilla. Scrape down sides as needed. Mix well but don’t over-beat. Pour into crust and smooth top.
4. **Bake:** Wrap the springform pan in a large piece of aluminium foil (folding up the sides). Place in a roasting pan and add boiling water until it comes halfway up the sides of the cheesecake pan (foil prevents seepage). Bake 45 minutes. The cheesecake should still jiggle (it firms up after chilling), so don’t overcook. Cool in pan 30 minutes, then chill (loosely covered) at least 4 hours.
5. **Blueberry sauce:** Simmer blueberries, lemon zest/juice, and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat for ~5 minutes, until fruit begins to break down slightly. Cool, then spread on cheesecake.
